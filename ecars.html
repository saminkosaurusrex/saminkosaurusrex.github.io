                <p>EV batteries undergo cycles of 'discharge' that occur when driving and 'charge' when the car's plugged in. Repeating this process over time affects the amount of charge the battery can hold. This decreases the range and time needed between each journey to charge. Most manufacturers have a five to eight-year warranty on their battery. However, the current prediction is that an electric car battery will last from 10 – 20 years before they need to be replaced.</p>

              <h3>Are electric cars more efficient than gas-powered cars?</h3>
            </div>
            <div class="answer">
              Technically, electric motors are more efficient than gasoline or diesel engines and can provide cheaper operation per mile — but it depends on the cost of electricity and gasoline (or diesel) where you live, and EVs tend to cost more up front. EVs are the technology of choice for eco-friendly car buyers because they have no localized emissions tied to their operation; they can be powered with clean, renewable energy; and even when charged with power from nonrenewable sources, they release less carbon per mile (when similar vehicles are compared).

              <h3>Can I use public chargers to charge my electric car?</h3>
            </div>

            <div class="answer">
              Public charging should be viewed as an occasional convenience or means to venture past one’s own region. That’s because it’s often more expensive (or can become so without warning), and because even fast charging is usually timed in hours, not minutes, if you use a full gas tank and its associated range as your standard. Owning an EV without home charging is only for the truly devoted.

              <h3>How do cold temperatures affect electric cars?</h3>
            </div>

            <div class="answer">
              Cold is the Achilles’ heel of EVs regardless of make or model. Range can plummet as the battery pack cools, and the occupants sacrifice range further to heat the cabin electrically. According to a AAA study, EVs can lose more than 40% of their range at 20 degrees compared with 75 degrees Fahrenheit. Heated seats and steering wheels and the practice of preheating the cabin while the car’s still plugged in can take the sting out a bit, but the effects of cold must be factored in when determining how much range you need before purchasing.

              <h3>Which EVs are eligible for the federal tax credit?</h3>
            </div>

            <div class="answer">
              Though a federal tax credit worth up to $7,500 for longer-range electric cars remains for some EV automakers, Tesla and GM hit their sales caps in 2019 and are no longer eligible. The Biden administration has proposed more generous incentives, for which Tesla and GM EVs would again be eligible, but opposition has stymied progress. Now that many more EV models are on the market, other manufacturers might hit their sales limits, as well.
